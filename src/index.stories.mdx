> _Modern user interfaces are assembled from hundreds of modular UI components

> contain reusable UI components that help teams build complex, durable, and
> accessible user interfaces across projects. Since both designers and
> developers contribute to the UI components, the design system serves as a
> bridge between disciplines. It is also the “source of truth” for an
> organization’s common components._
